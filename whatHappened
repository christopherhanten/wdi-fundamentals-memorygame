I ran into some issues on the last 2 days of the project. 
I am not very happy with the results. 
I know that it's probably something silly, 
but I had to come to a stopping point.

Also, git wasn't displaying all of my latest verisions.
I went ahead and dragged them in.

I can't wait for class to start!
